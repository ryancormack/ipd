INSONO creates a unique bridge between people on the move and unsigned music. Commenting on the connection between physical and musical exploration, INSONO explores the way they interact with each other.

INSONO has been designed to be an mp3 player that connects unsigned artists with people exploring different cities. GPS and track tagging is used to give the user 1st hand experience of the citys musical culture. As the user travels around different areas of the city, music by local artists is played in the artists local areas.

This simple, yet unique, interaction allows unsigned artists to gain exposure in a way that has never been possible before.
