What could a social network tool help us with? Our relationship with others? Or just the virtual part of it. The status cup. Inspired by the most common things in our lives, is trying to focus more on real life social activities. Different from other cups, this unique cup has three hidden status printed on it. When the backlights are shifted on, which makes the hidden words seen. you could choose one by rotating the holder according to what kind of mood you are in. "Hey There" means you are ready . "Busy Now", however, explains your unavailability, then "Be Right Back" could somehow buy you some time to finish what you are focusing on. Without a sound, you could draw attention of those you want to know and, on the other hand, avoid conversation you don't want to get involved into.
